                <h2 class="para-sub-head"> COOKIES, OTHER TRACKING DEVICES AND TARGETED ADVERTISING </h2>
                <p class="paras"> A cookie is a small piece of data sent from the Sites and stored in a user's web browser while the user is browsing Sites (“<b>Cookie</b>”). Every time the user loads Sites, the browser sends the Cookie back to the server to notify the Sites of the user's previous activity. Web beacons (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses (“<b>Web beacons</b>”). We also utilize pixels in connection with our email communications and in connection with the Sites. Our Sites' web server automatically collects and we may use your Cookies, Web beacons, pixels and other similar tracking technologies (collectively “<b>Tracking Technologies</b>”) to collect information as you browse our Sites. We use Tracking Technologies, web server log files and tracking code, and information we receive through the use of these Tracking Technologies to analyze trends, administer the Sites, track users’ movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Information of this type may be combined with other sources of information for these purposes.  Certain pages of the Sites, and promotional email messages, or newsletters we send, may contain Tracking Technologies that allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.</p>
                <p class="paras"> Some of these Tracking Technologies may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications. These Tracking Technologies may be used by these service providers to place a persistent Cookie on your computer. Doing this allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views. The use of Tracking Technologies by third party service providers is within their control and not ours. We do not control their Sites or their policies and practices regarding your information and you should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by third parties in connection with their advertisements or promotions and other sites you encounter on the Internet. This Policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party service provider may directly collect from you and we do not undertake to confirm, investigate, or police their practices. For example, we work with the below:
                </p>
                <p class="paras"> <b>Google Analytics.</b> To help facilitate the delivery of relevant content, we use Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses Cookies to report on user interactions on our and others' websites. We use the data collected for optimizing marketing, refining advertising and/or programming strategies, and generally improving user experience. For more information about Google Analytics and how it collects and processes data, please visit: 
                  <a href=" https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites"> https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites.</a> Instructions on opting out of Google Analytics using a specific plug-in is available at the following link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>. Note that this opt-out is specific to Google activities and does not affect the activities of other ad networks or analytics providers that we may use.
                  </p>
                <p class="paras"><b>Facebook Analytics.</b> We also use Facebook Analytics to measure your use of our Sites, tailor our Sites to your interests, and improve our products and services. Please note, Facebook can connect this data with your Facebook account and use it for its own advertising purposes, in accordance with Facebook’s Data Policy which can be found at Facebook.com/about/privacy/. Please click <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads#_=">here</a> if you would like to withdraw your consent. </p>
                <p class="paras"> The practice of collecting these Tracking Technologies is a standard practice on the Internet. If you do not want us to collect your Cookies, you can set your browsers or third-party software to reject Cookies. If you reject the Cookie, you may be unable to use portions of our Sites that require registration, some pages of the Sites might not function properly, and the Sites experience will not be capable of being tailored to you from visit to visit. Also note that even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising, these Tracking Technologies may still collect data for other purposes including analytics and you will still see ads from us, but the ads will not be targeted based on behavioral information about you and may therefore be less relevant to you and your interests. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for more information about how to turn these Cookies on and off for your browser. The Network Advertising Initiative also offers a means to opt-out of a number of advertising Cookies. Please visit their website here to learn more and to opt-out, if desired. Additionally, the Digital Advertising Alliance provides an opt-out mobile app to control interest-based advertising on apps on your mobile device, available on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appchoices/id894822870?mt=8">Apple Store</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DAA.appchoices&hl=en">Google Play</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Advertising-Alliance-AppChoices/dp/B00SVQ4FMO">Amazon’s Appstore</a>.</p>
                <p class="paras"> By visiting our Sites, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities through use of these Tracking Technologies and that we may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send you. You will not be subjected to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling. </p>
